# `settings` folder

The folder keeps files with data for `student` application.

## Examples

Most of the properties have `string` type. Their values are used as buttons', headings', labels' texts, and HTML element IDs.

## Code style

Each property name should use a postfix related with type of the value.

- `HTML` for `string` type that need to be displayed as HTML (after sanitization).
- `HTMLID` for `string` type that need to be specifies as HTML ID (`id="elementID"`).
- `Text` for `string` type that need to be displayed as text with escaping by Angular.
- `URL` for `string` type that can be used as a value of `href` attributes of `<a>` tag for example.
